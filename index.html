        <h1>Title: It's My Life</h1>
        <h2>Genre: Alternative Rock</h2>
        <h2>By: Bom Jovi</h2>
        <p>This ain't a song for the brokenhearted<br>
        No silent prayer for the faith departed<br>
        And I ain't going to be just a face in the crowd<br>
        You're going to hear my voice when I shout it out loud</p>
        
        <p>It's my life<br>
        It's now or never<br>
        I ain't going to live forever<br>
        I just want to live while I'm alive</p>
        
        <p>It's my life<br>
        My heart is like an open highway<br>
        Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"<br>
        I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
        Because it's my life</p>
        
        <p>This is for the ones who stood their ground<br>
        For Tommy and Gina who never backed down<br>
        Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake<br>
        Luck ain't even lucky<br>
        Got to make your own breaks</p>
        
        <p>It's my life<br>
        And it's now or never<br>
        I ain't going to live forever<br>
        I just want to live while I'm alive</p>
        
        <p>It's my life<br>
        My heart is like an open highway<br>
        Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"<br>
        I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
        Because it's my life</p>
        
        <p>You better stand tall<br>
        When they're calling you out<br>
        Don't bend, don't break<br>
        Baby, don't back down</p>
        
        <p>It's my life<br>
        It's now or never<br>
        Because I ain't going to live forever<br>
        I just want to live while I'm alive</p>
        
        <p>It's my life<br>
        My heart is like an open highway<br>
        Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"<br>
        I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
        (bis)</p>
